# Bus-booking-application
This web application, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), provides a user-friendly platform for booking bus tickets. Users can search for buses based on various criteria, select seats from interactive maps, and make secure online payments. An admin dashboard allows for managing bus routes, schedules, and bookings.
